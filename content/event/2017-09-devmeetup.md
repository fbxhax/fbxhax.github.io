Fairbanks developers are looking to get together to form a dev/programmer meetup in Fairbanks and form a bit of a community around that.

The group is not yet sure what it'll become - could a web dev meetup, a linux meetup, an AI group, whatever- depending on interest and skills.

* Time is TBD: (fill out doodle poll below to help select a time)
* Location is at the Fairbanks [Attently.io](https://attently.io/) offices (details coming with date selection).
* There'll be food and drinks.

Here's the doodle poll to find a time:
