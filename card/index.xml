      <description>We want Fairbanks Hackathon to be an open and inclusive community. We have a public GitHub organization for projects managed by the FBXHAX community. Our website, both the source content and site hosting, is on GitHub as a public repository.

If you do not already have a GitHub account create one and we encourage you to star, or even watch, our website repository on GitHub.

You are encouraged to help us improve the website through reporting bugs/ideas/content on our issue tracker.</description>

      <description>Fairbanks Hackathon provides the community a few methods of connecting with each other:
Fairbanks Hackathon GitHub organization

Fairbanks Hackathon has a Gitter FairbanksHackathon Lobby chat channel. We use this to help plan events and provide a central chat channel during events. Just need a GitHub identity to join!

We also use our issue tracker to collect and organize hacking ideas for hackathons. If you have an idea or problem you think would be great to be put forward during a hackathon event toss it into our website issue tracker.</description>
