      <description>Fairbanks developers are looking to get together to form a dev/programmer meetup in Fairbanks and form a bit of a community around that.
The group is not yet sure what it&amp;rsquo;ll become - could a web dev meetup, a linux meetup, an AI group, whatever- depending on interest and skills.
 Time is TBD: (fill out doodle poll below to help select a time) Location is at the Fairbanks Attently.io offices (details coming with date selection).</description>
