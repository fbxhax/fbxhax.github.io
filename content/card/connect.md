Fairbanks Hackathon provides the community a few methods of connecting with each other:

[Fairbanks Hackathon GitHub organization](https://github.com/fbxhax)

We dont' have a Gitter/Discord/Twitter.

We also use our [issue tracker](https://github.com/fbxhax/fbxhax.github.io/issues) to collect and organize hacking ideas for hackathons.  If you have an idea or problem you think would be great to be put forward during a hackathon event toss it into our [website issue tracker](https://github.com/fbxhax/fbxhax.github.io/issues
